# wcap-for-delphi
The wcap.wrapper Delphi package provides a wrapper for the Windows Capture (WCap) library, which is a low-level packet capture library for Windows.

The package contains several units including: 

+ **wcap.wrapper.pas:**  which wraps the functions of the WCap DLL.
+ **wcap.consts.pas:**   which contains constants used in the library. 
+ **wcap.types.pas:**    which contains structures used by the library. 
+ **wcap.protocol.pas:** which contains functions for managing protocols.
+ **wcap.StrUtils.pas:** which contains string manipulation functions.

It enables the capture and analysis of network packets, making it useful for a wide range of applications, including network analysis, security testing, and network monitoring.
